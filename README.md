# üêæ Species Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project focuses on the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify different animal species from images. It serves as an initial exploration into the architecture and application of CNNs in the field of species classification.

## üìú Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a CNN capable of distinguishing between eight specific animal species. This foundational work lays the groundwork for future expansion, allowing the model to be scaled to identify a broader range of species.

### Key Features:

- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Developed a CNN tailored for the task of species identification. Various architectures and hyperparameters were tested to optimize model performance.
  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented robust data preprocessing techniques including image augmentation, normalization, and resizing to ensure consistent and high-quality input data.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Trained the CNN using a well-curated dataset and evaluated its performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques like regularization and dropout were used to prevent overfitting.

- **Scalability**: The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the model to be easily extended to recognize additional species in the future.
